Hello, world!

This is my special place where I post all the fun things that are broadcast to the world...

Come hang ~~~ (in some way..., leave an issue I guess?)

---

Sometimes I do things on my computer and sometimes those end up on Github, this place here where, you know, people leave bits of themselves for others to sort through.

If you have something fun that you want to collaborate on, please reach out!

One of my current (past ~5 years) existential interests involve things like "dataflow," "types," "APIs", "optimization", "DSLs", by which I mean exploring how people can talk to computers, the languages we write to communicate with them, how we collaborate on those languages, and in general what kinds of fun worlds we can create to "live in" (if existing in abstract parts of ones mind entails living?)
