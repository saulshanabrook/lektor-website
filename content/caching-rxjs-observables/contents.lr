body:

I think I am going deep enough down this hole that I should start writing about it.  It's scary though, because I know I am so far down, that I wonder if anyone else will be able to see in at all! I have noticed  this is a habit of mine. I will venture along alone, and get too  far into a corner to figure out how to draw the line from where I started.
