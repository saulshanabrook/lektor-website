title: λω for Metadsl
---
body:

I think that [metadsl](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/metadsl) is a λω / System F-ω language.

Should we represent the type system outside of the Python representation?


Probably, at the moment, no. Let's just represent it implicitly using Python's type signatures.
